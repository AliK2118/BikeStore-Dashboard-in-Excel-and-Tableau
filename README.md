## Objectives 
- understand customer profile of bike purchasers vs. non-purchasers.
- identify **factors influencing bike sales** (e.g.,income, marital status).
- Visualize **sales trends and relationships** between different demographic variables.
- Practice **data analysis workflow** from database creation to storytelling with data.

## Data Insights and Recommendations
Some key insights based on the store's sales data that can be used in enhancing decision-making, 
marketing strategies, and operational efficiency are as follows:
 1. **Sales Analysis**:
    - Mountain bikes contributed the biggest percentage of the total revenue.
    - Most sales were realized in 2017 whereas April, 2018 had the highest revenue.
    - *Recommendation*:
       - Increase stock and introduce new models in this category.
       - consider increasing marketing efforts in order to maximize revenue.
 2. **Staff & Store Performance**:
    - The Rowlett Bikes store in Texas underperformed in revenue.
    - There was a significant gap between the top and the bottom performing sales staff.
    - *Recommendation*:
       - Evaluate store location viability - focus on cycling-friendly areas or retrain sales staff.
       - Provide staff training in the lower-performing store to standardize customer experience and improve upselling skills
       - introduce performance incentives.

 3. **Customer Analysis**
    - identified high-value and repeat customers for the three years.
    - identified customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
    - *Recommendation*:
       - need to implement loyalty programs where customers can earn points for each purchase that can be redeemed for discounts
       - introduce some exclusive offers and email campaigns based on past purchasing behavior to encourage repeat business among valuable customer segments (e.g.,
         "It's time for a new bike light!" or "Get 10% off your next Mountain bike purchase") .
       - insure the website is mobile-optimized  so as to offer smooth browsing and purchasing experience on mobile devices.
